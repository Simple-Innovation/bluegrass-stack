## Overview

The server code in `./api/request-handler/index.ts` imports the [Remix Server Adapter for Azure Functions](https://www.npmjs.com/package/remix-azure) and exports the `handler` that is built by _requiring_ the Remix Application server code compiled into `./api/build`.

## Building the Remix Server for the Azure Function

The server needs the application route information, the Remix server code and the server adapter package. These pieces create the server function that respond to client route and data requests. The Remix Server code is built to be deployed into the Azure Function API. The `./api` folder contains configuration data to build the Azure Function independently of the Remix application.

### Build the Remix server code

The first step in preparing the server is to build the Remix App so the route
information and server code can be made available to the server function.

`/package.json` defines the script to build the Remix application.

```json
  "scripts": {
    "build:app": "remix build",
  },
```

Remix uses `/remix.config.js` to set the location of the server code to
`./api/build/index.js`.

```js
module.exports = {
  serverBuildPath: 'api/build/index.js',
}
```

### Build the Remix Server Azure Function

The next step is to build the Remix Server Azure Function. The `./api` folder
contains the source and configuration to build and deploy the Azure Function.
The `./api/package.json` file defines the build packages and script.

```json
  "scripts": {
    "build:api": "tsc",
  },
  "dependencies": {
    "@remix-run/node": "^1.5.1",
    "@remix-run/react": "^1.5.1",
    "@remix-run/serve": "^1.5.1",
    "remix-azure": "^0.0.1-alpha.1"
  },
```

`api/request-handler/index.ts` is the source for the Remix Server Azure
Function. The Remix application code from `./api/build/index.js` is _required_
into the Remix Server handler. The Remix Server handler is provided by
[Remix Server Adapter for Azure Functions](https://www.npmjs.com/package/remix-azure).
The `tsconfig.json` file sets the output directory to `./api/dist`.

```json
  "compilerOptions": {
    "module": "commonjs",
    "target": "es6",
    "outDir": "dist",
    "rootDir": ".",
    "sourceMap": true,
    "strict": false,
    "esModuleInterop": true
  }

```

The `./api/request-handler/function.json` file configures the Azure Function
runtime and entry point, When deployed, Azure looks for folders with a
`function.json` file and uses it to publish the function. The `scriptFile`
property defines the function entry point `../dist/request-handler/index.js`.

```json
{
  "bindings": [
    {
      "authLevel": "anonymous",
      "type": "httpTrigger",
      "direction": "in",
      "name": "req",
      "methods": ["get", "post"]
    },
    {
      "type": "http",
      "direction": "out",
      "name": "$return"
    }
  ],
  "scriptFile": "../dist/request-handler/index.js"
}
```

## Routing

Azure Static Web Apps handle routes by rewriting URLs to the Azure Function API.
Static assets have a route defined in `./public/staticwebapp.config.json`. A
wildcard route maps the rest of the application routes through the Azure
Function API.

```json
  "routes": [
    {
      "route": "/favicon.ico"
    },
    {
      "route": "/build/*"
    },
    {
      "route": "/*",
      "rewrite": "/api/request-handler"
    }
  ]
```

## Static Web App CLI

The [Azure Static Web App CLI](https://azure.github.io/static-web-apps-cli/)
allows the developer to build and debug the application locally with an
emulator. `/swa-cli.config.json` configures the SWA CLI commands for building
and running the emulator.

```json
{
  "$schema": "https://aka.ms/azure/static-web-apps-cli/schema",
  "configurations": {
    "remix-client-azure": {
      "appName": "remix-client",
      "appLocation": ".",
      "appBuildCommand": "npm run build:app",
      "appDevserverUrl": "http://localhost:3000",
      "outputLocation": "public\\build",

      "apiLocation": "api",
      "apiBuildCommand": "npm run build:api --if-present",

      "run": "npm run dev",

      "resourceGroupName": "remix-app-rg",
      "env": "preview"
    }
  }
}
```

### swa build

Running `swa build` performs the build steps defined in `/swa-cli.config.json`.
The first step [builds the Remix application](#build-the-remix-server-code) with
`npm run build:app` defined by `appBuildCommand`. Static assets are built into
`./public/build`. Server components are built into `./api/build/index.js`. The
second step
[builds the Azure Function API](#build-the-remix-server-azure-function) from the
`./api` directory with `npm run build:api`.

### swa start

Running `swa start` runs the application in an Azure SWA emulator using the
configuration from `/swa-cli.config.json`. The Remix dev environment is started
with `npm run dev` defined by `run`. The emulator proxies to the Remix dev
server set with `appDevserverUrl`. This lets the developer
[use the Remix framework](https://azure.github.io/static-web-apps-cli/docs/cli/swa-start#serve-from-a-dev-server)
for things like 'live reload' and HMR. Azure Function definitions found in
`apiLocation` are started to serve API requests.

```console
$ swa build

## Quickstart

Click this button to create a [Gitpod](https://gitpod.io) workspace with the project set up

[![Gitpod Ready-to-Code](https://img.shields.io/badge/Gitpod-Ready--to--Code-blue?logo=gitpod)](https://gitpod.io/from-referrer/)

## Development

- This step only applies if you've opted out of having the CLI install dependencies for you:

  ```sh
  npx remix init
  ```

- Initial setup: _If you just generated this project, this step has been done for you._

  ```sh
  npm run setup
  ```

- Start dev server:

  ```sh
  npm run dev
  ```

This starts your app in development mode, rebuilding assets on file changes.

The database seed script creates a new user with some data you can use to get started:

- Email: `rachel@remix.run`
- Password: `racheliscool`

### Relevant code:

This is a pretty simple note-taking app, but it's a good example of how you can build a full stack app with Prisma and Remix. The main functionality is creating users, logging in and out, and creating and deleting notes.

- creating users, and logging in and out [./app/models/user.server.ts](./app/models/user.server.ts)
- user sessions, and verifying them [./app/session.server.ts](./app/session.server.ts)
- creating, and deleting notes [./app/models/note.server.ts](./app/models/note.server.ts)

## Deployment

This Remix Stack comes with two GitHub Actions that handle automatically deploying your app to production and staging environments.

Prior to your first deployment, you'll need to do a few things:

  - Initialize Git.

  ```sh
  git init
  ```

- Create a new [GitHub Repository](https://repo.new), and then add it as the remote for your project. **Do not push your app yet!**

  ```sh
  git remote add origin <ORIGIN_URL>
  ```

  If you don't have openssl installed, you can also use [1password](https://1password.com/password-generator/) to generate a random secret, just replace `$(openssl rand -hex 32)` with the generated secret.

Now that everything is set up you can commit and push your changes to your repo. Every commit to your `main` branch will trigger a deployment to your production environment, and every commit to your `dev` branch will trigger a deployment to your staging environment.

### Connecting to your database

### Getting Help with Deployment

## GitHub Actions

We use GitHub Actions for continuous integration and deployment. Anything that gets into the `main` branch will be deployed to production after running tests/build/etc. Anything in the `dev` branch will be deployed to staging.

## Testing

### Cypress

We use Cypress for our End-to-End tests in this project. You'll find those in the `cypress` directory. As you make changes, add to an existing file or create a new file in the `cypress/e2e` directory to test your changes.

We use [`@testing-library/cypress`](https://testing-library.com/cypress) for selecting elements on the page semantically.

To run these tests in development, run `npm run test:e2e:dev` which will start the dev server for the app as well as the Cypress client. Make sure the database is running in docker as described above.

We have a utility for testing authenticated features without having to go through the login flow:

```ts
cy.login();
// you are now logged in as a new user
```

We also have a utility to auto-delete the user at the end of your test. Just make sure to add this in each test file:

```ts
afterEach(() => {
  cy.cleanupUser();
});
```

That way, we can keep your local db clean and keep your tests isolated from one another.

### Vitest

For lower level tests of utilities and individual components, we use `vitest`. We have DOM-specific assertion helpers via [`@testing-library/jest-dom`](https://testing-library.com/jest-dom).

### Type Checking

This project uses TypeScript. It's recommended to get TypeScript set up for your editor to get a really great in-editor experience with type checking and auto-complete. To run type checking across the whole project, run `npm run typecheck`.

### Linting

This project uses ESLint for linting. That is configured in `.eslintrc.js`.

### Formatting

We use [Prettier](https://prettier.io/) for auto-formatting in this project. It's recommended to install an editor plugin (like the [VSCode Prettier plugin](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=esbenp.prettier-vscode)) to get auto-formatting on save. There's also a `npm run format` script you can run to format all files in the project.
